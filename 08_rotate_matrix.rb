# A 2D matrix (not necessarily a square matrix) is given
# in the form of a multi-line string.
# Write a program that rotates the matrix 90 degrees
# counter clockwise.
# Assume that lines are separated by "\n" and cells are
# separated by spaces.
# 
# Eg. The input string "a b c\nd e f\ng h i" when printed
# results:
#   a b c
#   d e f
#   g h i
# 
# You need to translate it to "c f i\nb e h\na d g", which
# prints to:
#   c f i
#   b e h
#   a d g
